This project displays 24 photos from flicker. I have an interest in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) so the defaullt photos are BJJ photos.
The navigation links display three different types of submissions the armbar, omoplata and chokes. 
I made the following edits to the CSS
* Added an Icon size class to resize 404 not found icon
* changed the background image of the site to a black carbon fiber look. I felt this really goes with the bjj theme of the site
* Added a white border to the photos as well as changed the on hover to 1.75
